        <h2>FOAC “DAGITAB” CLASS 2024-23</h2>
        <p>On May 13, 2024, new batch of Fire Officers Advance Course (FOAC) were welcomed by the National Fire Training Institute (NFTI), through an opening ceremony lead by then NFTI Director, FCSUPT BELINDA B OCHAVE. The ceremony was attended by the Class Officers of FOAC Class 2024-23 onsite, while other members of the class joined the ceremony online. The highlight of the program is the message of the Keynote Speaker, FCUSPT OCHAVE, who left a remarkable message saying “As officers, you should act like officers”. After which, a token of appreciation was given to the NFTI Director by the class officers led by the Class President SO CIARA LEY L CAPULE. 

            The FOAC 2024-23 is composed of 57 fire officers with rank of Fire Senior Inspectors who came across the different parts of the country but united in this endeavor to upgrade their knowledge and skills that they need as they elevate into higher ranks and positions.
        
            The class name DAGITAB means “spark” just like the passion of every member of the class that keeps burning in service to God, country, and people. It also reflected in the meaning of its acronym as “Dedikadong mga Alagad ng batas, sa Gampanin ay maasahan at Inspirasyongmaglingkod Tungo sa pag-Asenso ngBansang Pilipinas”. </p>
